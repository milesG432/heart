                <p>PulseStore allows you to take orders (and if you wish, payments) via the Internet. You may have a current website and prefer to link to your new ‘shop’ site, or you may prefer it to be a separate entity living at a separate web address. It may be primarily as a valuable new service for your existing customers, or it might be a consumer site attracting all new business.</p>

                <p>PulseStore is extremely flexible. It is designed to give you great control over the way your site looks and the fresh content you wish to present.</p>

                <p>From the colour or graphics used on the site, to special offers or features you would like to use - you are in control.</p>
